# Terraform ECR->Lambda üêî & ü•ö Problem

## General

* Description: Solution to Terraform-AWS Lambda-ECR chicken and egg problem.
* Built With:
  * [Terraform for AWS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)
  * [Terraform for Docker](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/kreuzwerker/docker/latest/docs)

## Problem Description

Defining Lambda Function with ECR Image and ECR image within the same Terraform build path.

This Lambda Function definition requires the ECR image tagged "latest" within the repository built in same Terraform configuration.

```hcl
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "repository" {
  name = "foo"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "foo" {
  function_name = "bar"
  role = aws_iam_role.foo.arn
  package_type = "Image"
  image_uri = "${aws_ecr_repository.repository.repository_url}:latest"
}
```

Resulting in error configuring the lambda function as no image has been added to the ecr repository.

## [Solution](solution/)

Introduce the docker provider to the Terraform Configuration and build docker through Terraform.

Docker provider authorized to build image on ecr repository.

### Notes

General terraform CLI build sequence works with this solution.

  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform validate
  terraform apply
  ```
